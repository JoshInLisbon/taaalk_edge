  <p>Taaalk Privacy Policy</p>

  <p>1.1 Basic Account Information</p>

  <p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Taaalk profiles or reading conversations. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Joe Blogs”), a password, and an email address or phone number. In future this may include a username so users can communicate directly with you through a mention, e.g “hi @JoeBlogs”) Your display name is  always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also create and manage multiple Taaalk accounts, for example to express different parts of your identity. You can create multiple conversation participants (Speakers) from the same account, even within the same conversation. Each Speaker can have its own profile photo, name and bio. Speakers can be pseudonyms. DO NOT IMPERSONATE/USER AS A PSEUDONYM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AS A SPEAKER IN A CONVERSATION, THIS WILL BE SEEN TO BE A VIOLATION OF OUR TERMS.</p>

  <p>Your email is saved as a string in our database. This means it may be read by staff members and visible to hackers, should we be hacked. If data is accidentally leaked then it may also become publicly visible. It will not be shared with any external party without your consent. There are no current intentions to share your email with any third party. The privacy policy will be updated, and you shall be notified, if this changes. </p>

  <p>1.2 Public Information</p>

  <p>Most activity on Taaalk is public, including your profile information, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Taaalk and their messages and certain information about your Taaalks like the date, time, and application and version of Taaalk you interacted on. You also may choose to publish your location or your Taaalk profile. In future, the lists you create, accounts you follow and conversations you follow and who follows you and your conversations may become public. If you like, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Your hearts/likes, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received may also become public. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. </p>

  <p>You are responsible for your Taaalks and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Taaalk, such as by deleting your account, we will reflect your updated content on our Services. If external services (such as https://archive.org/web/) have scraped content/conversations publicially available on Taaalk and stored it/made it public, we will not be held responsible for the existance of this content. </p>

  <p>By publicly posting content when you Taaalk, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Taaalks to people around the world, we may use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying a Taaalk on a news website or analyzing what people say on Taaalk. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Taaalk, and their offerings may not reflect what you have written/posted/uploaded on Taaalk. </p>

  <p>1.3 Contact Information and Address Books</p>

  <p>We may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We may also use contact information to enable certain account features (for example, for login verification via SMS), and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Taaalk to that number as your country’s laws allow. Though we do not do so currently, and have no plans to do so currently, Taaalk may also use your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. </p>

  <p>In future, you may choose to upload and sync your address book on Taaalk so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.</p>

  <p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request and/or save your email/message for future use and/or internal discussion.</p>

  <p>1.4 Public Communications</p>

  <p>Taaalk has no private messaging feature. Assume all things written on Taaalk excluding your email address and password (as used to sign up) are publicly visible. </p>

  <p>1.5 Payment Information</p>

  <p>In future, you may provide us with payment information6, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address, in order to purchase advertising/sponsor a Taaalk/sponser a user or other offerings provided as part of our services. Payments will likely be processed with an external payment processor (such as Stripe). This information will be updated then.</p>

  <p>Cookies</p>

Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not support the Do Not Track browser option. </p>

  <p>Log Data</p>

  <p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Taaalk content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information.

  <p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.</p>

  <p>2.6 Advertisers and Other Ad Partners</p>

  <p>We do not currently allow advertising on our site. The following information is set out for future possibilities, should advertising be placed on the Taaalk website. Advertising revenue would allow us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Taaalk from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Taaalk and that Taaalk receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>Service Providers</p>

For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). If we one day take payment, we will share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>

  <p>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.</p>

  <p>Affiliates and Change of Ownership</p>

This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
